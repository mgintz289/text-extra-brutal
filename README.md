# text-extra-brutal

This [Spicetify]([url](https://spicetify.app/)) theme removes some distractions from Spotify such as the homepage, further reducing the [text]([url](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/text)) theme. It still works with some visual abnormalities as of December 18 2025, but will likely become less functional over time. Those interested in this repository are encouraged to
<ul>
  <li>bring it up to date</li>
  <li>implement more clear options depending on what the user does and does not want visible (their "level of brutality").</li>
</ul>
